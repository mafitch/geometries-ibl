                <li>There exist exactly four points.</li>
                <li>Any two distinct points have exactly one line on both of them.</li>
                <li>Each line is on exactly two points.</li>
            </ol></p>

    <exercise><p>Explore the four point geometry as follows.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Draw and label four points.</li>
        <li>Use axiom 2 to draw as many lines as possible.</li>
        <li>How many lines exist in this geometry?</li>
        <li>Find a pair of parallel lines.</li>
        <li>Can you find three lines that are pairwise parallel?</li>
