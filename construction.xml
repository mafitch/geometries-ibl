<title>Constructions</title>

<introduction>

<p>For each construction figure out how to do it using the classic Greek tools: a straight edge and rusty compass (okay that isn't quite classic Greek). Note you can use the circle and line tools in Geogebra to perform these. Next prove that your construction works.</p>
