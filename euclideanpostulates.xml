<title>Equivalent Parallel Postulates</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>Each of the following is an equivalent Euclidean postulate.</p>

    <list>
        <title>Equivalent Euclidean Postulates</title>
    <ul>
        <li>(<em>Playfair</em>) Given a line and a point not on that line, there exists exactly one line through that point parallel to the given line.</li>
        <li>(<em>Equidistance</em>) Lines that are parallel are everywhere equidistant.</li>
        <li>(<em>Euclid</em>) Given two lines and a transversal of those lines, if the sum of the angles on one side of the transversal is less than two right angles then the lines meet on that side.</li>
    </ul>
    </list>

            <p>These theorems do not require a parallel postulate.</p>

            <theorem>
                <title>Alternate Interior Angles</title>
                <statement><p>If the alternate interior angles formed by a transversal of two lines are equal, then the lines are parallel.</p></statement>
                </theorem>

            <theorem>
                <title>Point to line distance</title>
                <statement><p>The (shortest) distance between a point and a line is from the point to the foot of the perpendicular.</p></statement>

                <title>Convenient Euclid Parallel Axiom</title>
                <statement><p>Given two lines and a transversal of those lines, if the sum of the angles on one side of the transversal is equal to two right angles then the lines are parallel.</p></statement>

        <title>Equivalency</title>

            <p>The following theorem produces an easier to use version of Euclid's postulate.</p>

            <theorem><p>Euclid's postulate and Theorem <xref ref="parallelright" /> are equivalent to the following. "The sum of the angles on one side of a transversal of two lines is equal to the sum of two right angles if and only if the lines are parallel."</p></theorem>

            <theorem><p>Euclid's postulate implies Playfair's axiom.</p></theorem>

            <theorem><p>Playfair's axiom implies the alternate interior angle converse theorem.</p></theorem>

            <p>The alternate interior angle converse theorem states ``Given parallel lines and a transversal of those lines, the alternate interior angles formed by the transversal are congruent.''</p>

            <theorem><p>Playfair and the alternating interior angle converse theorem imply the equidistance of parallel lines.</p></theorem>

            <theorem><p>The equidistance of parallel lines implies Euclid's postulate.</p></theorem>

            <theorem><p>Prove the three postulates are all equivalent.</p></theorem>
