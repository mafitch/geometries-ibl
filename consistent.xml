            <statement><p>Use the following axioms and definitions of intersection and parallel as a definition of the five point geometry.</p>
            <p><ol>
                    <li>There exist exactly five points.</li>
                    <li>There exist exactly five lines.</li>
                    <li>Any two distinct points have exactly one line on both of them.</li>
                    <li>Each line is on exactly two points.</li>

                <li>Draw five points using Geogebra.</li>
                <li>Use Axiom 3 to draw all required lines.</li>
                <li>How many lines did you construct?</li>
