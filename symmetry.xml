		<title>Tesselation</title>
		<statement><p>A covering of the plane is a <term>tesselation</term> if and only if it consists of a single shape infinitely reproduced using a finite set of transformations.</p></statement>

		<title>Conway Label</title>
		<statement><p>The following labeling of tesselations derives from the book <em>The Symmetries of Things</em> by John Conway, Heidi Burgiel, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss. Follow these steps in order to identify and label the type of symmetry group of a tesselation. The resulting notation is called the <em>signature</em></p>

	<p><ol>
		<li> Identify all lines of reflection.</li>
		<li> If two or more lines of reflection intersect in a point, write <m>*n_1n_2 \ldots</m> where <m>n_1,</m> <m>n_2,</m> are the number of lines intersecting at each unique point of intersection.</li>
		<li> If any line of reflection does not intersect other lines of reflection, just write one <m>*</m> for each of these.</li>
		<li> Identify any rotations that are not the composition of reflections already listed.</li>
		<li> Write <m>n_1n_2 \ldots </m> in front of any <m>*</m> for each rotation where <m>n_1,</m> <m>n_2</m> are the order of the rotations.</li>
		<li> Identify any glide reflections that are not the composition of reflections or rotations already listed.</li>
		<li> Write <m>\times</m> at the end of the signature for each of these glide reflections.</li>
		<li> Identify any translations that are not the composition of other symmetries already listed.</li>
		<li> Write <m>\circ</m> at the front of the signature for each pair of these translations.</li>
