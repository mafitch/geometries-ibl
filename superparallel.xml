	<title>Saccheri Quadrilateral</title>
	<statement><p>A quadrilateral is a <term>Saccheri quadrilateral</term> if and only if it has two consecutive right angles adjacent to two congruent sides. The side orthogonal to two sides is the base. The opposite side is the summit.</p></statement>
</definition>

<theorem><p>The non-right angles in a Saccheri quadrilateral are congruent.</p></theorem>

<theorem><p>The line segment joining the midpoint of the base to the midpoint of the summit is orthogonal to both.</p></theorem>

<lemma><p>Let <m>ABCD</m> be a Saccheri quadrilateral with right angles at <m>A</m> and <m>B.</m> Prove that <m>\angle AD\Omega \cong \angle BC\Omega.</m></p></lemma>

<theorem><p>The non-right angles in a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute.</p></theorem>
