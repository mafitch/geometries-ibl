<p>Note when working on these problems the model may be useful in figuring out why something works. However the proofs should be directly based on the axioms. It is legitimate to prove a statement using the model description if the model has been proven to be equivalent to the axioms. For this course proofs using the model will be worth fewer points than proofs directly from the axioms.</p>
